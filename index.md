# Favorite CPSC 120L Labs
* Lab 1

  This lab stands out as a favorite because it focuses on hands-on experience with Linux, git, GitHub, VS Code, and clang++. The practical exercise, involving cloning, editing, and submitting changes, enhances real-world skills.

* Lab 2

  This lab might be your favorite because it combines practical skills in git and GitHub usage, emphasizes good code formatting through automated tests, and encourages a structured approach, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.

* Lab 8

  I really enjoyed the continuous role swapping, frequent code commits, and emphasis on troubleshooting tools contribute to a dynamic and engaging learning experience. The lab's detailed instructions, flowcharts, and guidance from the TA ensure a comprehensive understanding of the material. Additionally, the encouragement to have fun adds a positive and enjoyable aspect to the learning process.
